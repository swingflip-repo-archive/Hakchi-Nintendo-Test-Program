Hakchi app to launch the internal Nintendo test program

This basic hakchi app will bypass the gui and launch the internel Nintendo testing application hidden on the mini. (This works on the SNES mini but should work on the NES?)

Here is a photo of the "Clover - Production test menu"

You might need to pull the power out to back out of some of the application tests. It might also give you a few errors but this doesn't cause any damage to the console or your build. Usually you have to find your way back to a SNES game and run it.

Have fun playing around with the official Nintendo test program.
